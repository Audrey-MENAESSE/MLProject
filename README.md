This repository contains the relevant code to train a model ... Higgs Boson Challenge

## Installation
A Python environment is required to run the scripts. More information can be found [here] (https://docs.python.org/fr/3/using/index.html).

## Usage
To create the csv file containing the results of the predictions, run the `run.py` script. 
It requires Python NumPy package as well as functions from `implementations.py` and `proj1_helpers.py`.

The `implementations.py` file also contains the implementations of standard machine learning methods as well as cross-validation and bias-variance analysis.

## Code architecture

The `zip` file contains :
* A README
* `proj1_helpers.py`
* `implementations.py`
* `run.py`
